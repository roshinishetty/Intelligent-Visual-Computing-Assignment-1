# Intelligent-Visual-Computing-Assignment-1
In this assignment, we construct the surface from the point cloud using the marching cubes algorithm. We used 2 different algorithms for computing the inherent function of each grid cell - Naive implementation of finding the distance from the nearest point's plane and Moving Least Squares implementation of determining weighted sum.
